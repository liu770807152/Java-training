# COMP1110/1140/6710 Sample Mid-Semester Exam

This repo contains an IntelliJ project that you can use as
 part of the **sample** mid-semester exam.   You will find the sample mid-semester
 exam [here](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/mse/sample/exam.html).

 You will find three questions, each a separate Java class with
  FIXME notes indicating what you need to do.   Each question is
  worth 5 marks.  There are 5 unit tests
  provided for each question with which you may test your answer.

In the exam, you will have about 7 and a half minutes in which to answer
each question, (since each is worth 5/20 marks and the
 exam is 30 mins long).

 Important notes:
 * The exam will be **entirely auto-graded**, so it is important that your code passes the tests.
 * The exam will not involve git.  Instead **you must copy your code into your
 exam in your browser**.
 * In the exam, the state of your exam is **continuously saved** (you don't need
 to press a save button).
